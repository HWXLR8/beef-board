    // lowest numbered pin using arduino naming. Note that the pins must be
    // consecutive in the RP2040 and may not correspond to consecutive numbers
    // in the arduino mapping. For instance, on the Arduino Nano RP2040 board,
    // pins D2 and D3 are GPIO25 and GPIO15, so they can not be used for this
    // purpose. However, pin D4 is GPIO16, which means pins D3 and D4 could be
    // used to connect the encoder by passing p3 as "firstPin" (and actually all
    // pins up to D9 are all consecutive). The method also sets the pins as
    // inputs and will turn on the pull-ups on the pins if "pullUp" is true.
    // Many encoders have open-collector outputs and require pull-ups. If
    // unsure, leave the default value of true.
